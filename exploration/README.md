# Exploration
The settlement monitoring is a long term initiative. We aim to explore different approaches and stay open to new opportunities, on the algorithm and data side.
In this folder, we will incoporate interesting work in the field as well as feature work from students and volunteers, who help create the building blocks making settlment monitoring a reality.
