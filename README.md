# UNICEF - Informal Settlement Monitoring

## Project
This particular project aims to develop an automated, machine learning based algorithms to estimate changes in the extent and populations of the informal settlements with known locations in Iraq using publicly available satellite imagery. The results of this project are expected to provide disaggregated and multi-temporal, geospatial information on informal settlements and their surroundings which can be used for the policy making process to enhance refugee childrenâ€™s living condition and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.


## Purpose
The dynamics of the population and extent of informal settlement can be a basis for various analysis to enhance the life quality of refugees and IDPs (Internally displaced person). You can read more in [docs/APPLICATIONS.md](docs/APPLICATIONS.md)


## Methodology
This project is inherently open-source. We will structure this respository and project to faciliate volunteer contributions.
Please follow the guidelines available in [CONTRIBUTING](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started and contribute as efficiently as possible.
Just a few quick notes:
	- Algorithms should use open-source technologies.
	- Dataset used should be open-source or easily available and trackable.
