# Applications
The dynamics of the population and extent of informal settlement can be a basis for various analysis to enhance the life quality of refugees and IDPs (Internally displaced person)

## Complement Census data
Humanitarian and development programmes are planned based on traditional census surveys. However, often these national surveys are only performed once every few years and sometimes they do not reach all areas for security reasons. On top of this, informal settlements vary at a much higher frequency. This method would bridge the gap between years where official measurements are available and would construct dynamic measures that can be continuously updated, that would help optimize planning and delivery of development and humanitarian programmes by NGOs and humanitarian agencies.

## Food security analysis
We are collaborating with WFP regarding the agricultural productivity and food security in Iraq. The results of this work can be used to assess the influences of the dynamics of IDP population on the food security and vulnerability.
## Poverty mapping
UNICEF innovation is currently working on mapping the poverty in Iraq using new sources of information like phone data. The dynamics of informal settlements can be combined with the poverty maps to assess how the dynamics of IDPs and refugees affects the distribution of poverty. It would also help to complement the ground truth data about population density, for areas where it changes quickly, especially due to conflict.

## Environmental quality assessment
Research regarding the relationships between the environmental quality and the expansion of informal settlement can be done based on the results of this collaboration 	

## Natural resources/Infrastructure management
The results of this study can be used to analyze the requirements for the natural resources such as water, firewood, and crop fields etc. and for infrastructures such as schools, health centers for the IDPs and refugees.
